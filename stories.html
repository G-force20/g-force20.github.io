        <h1>Stories</h1>
        <p>In Spring 2021 I broke my foot and was on crutches for six weeks. During this ordeal I realized just how difficult it is to get around Lehigh’s campus with mobility issues. 
        </p>
        <p>Lehigh’s historic academic buildings and residence halls do not have elevators. The campus is filled with uneven staircases, many without handrails. And, if someone can’t go up stairs they must have to travel long distances on roads to get around. 
        </p>
        <p>Lehigh provides AccessLU, and on demand bus service, to help students with physical disabilities get around campus. 
        </p>
        <p>David Krawczyk, a junior at Lehigh, had been on crutches for 5 of 8 weeks when I interviewed him. David said that once he figured out who to contact to get the service “it was really nice to be picked up at places that were a lot closer.”
        </p>
        <p>However, it took David a week to access the AccessLU service. “It was really rough at first because not only did I break my leg, but I also did not go through the right channels to get AccessLU at first.” 
        </p>
        <p>“I emailed one person and they referred me to one person who referred me to another person. It would have been nice if it was a little more streamlined,” David said. 
        </p>
        <p>David is not the only one who had a difficult time accessing the bus service. 
        </p>
        <p>Mika Kizuka broke her ankle on September 7th in a skateboarding incident on campus her first week here as a freshman in 2020. “I was in this weird limbo,” Mika said, “I gave AccessLU scans and paperwork and I wasn’t hearing back which was terrible.” 
        </p>
        <p>On September 22nd, two weeks after the injury, Mika finally received an email from the Associate Dean of Students and gained access to the on demand bus service. 
        </p>
        <p>Dean Zullo of Disability Support Services explained that the key issue that prevents students from getting access to resources is presenting correct documentation. 
        </p>
        <p>Although Mika, David, and I recounted excellent experiences with kind bus drivers, the AccessLU service is far from perfect. 
        </p>
        <p>Mika recalls a time when she was stranded at Rathbone after it had closed. Each time she called a ride it was “accepted then later rejected again and again and I was just stranded.”
        </p>
        <p>“The worst part is to give you an ETA that's always 10 minutes later than what it is right now. And then that will just keep incrementing, as time goes on. So forever, be 10 minutes, I've canceled a lot of rides because you know, I just didn't know if I had time or not and I waited like 15 minutes and then nothing happened,” David said. 
        </p>
        <p>Sharon Field, the Director of Transportation and Parking services explained several reasons for long wait times: “During peak times, more people need transportation which can present some challenges since there is one vehicle serving the community.” According to Sharon, for the year 2023 the maximum number of AccessLU passengers transported at once is 4.
        </p>
        <p>“It's really hard to plan to use AccessLU to get to class,” David said.
        </p>
        <p>Dean Zullo recognizes this as a problem, and wrote: “In response to a recent inquiry related to a student concern reported to DSS, the Transportation Office has indicated that they recognize the challenges and the failures the TransLoc on demand app has had. They are currently undergoing an assessment of both Transportation and & Parking Services. In June, they will receive recommendations, including an app for on demand service, which will better serve our community’s needs.”
        </p>
        <p>Injuries and physical accessibility issues also negatively impact academics and well-being. 
        </p>
        <p>Since the university was locked down for COVID, Mika only had one in-person class and said in response to long wait times for AccessLU: “At least I didn’t miss any classes for it.”
        </p>
        <p>David isn’t so lucky and sometimes skips his class on the third floor of Drown hall. “Even if I get to Drown, it's still brutal,” David said. Drown hall does not have an elevator.
        </p>
        <p>According to Dean Zullo, students are “always asked to notify DSS if they are experiencing any challenges with accessing housing, classes, or any other area of campus.” She described that RAS is often changing classroom locations so that they are accessible for students. 
        </p>
        <p>David, however, was unaware of the ability to request classroom changes. Mika requested a housing accommodation to be moved to a room on the first floor of Sayre Park, but was told there is no room available. In my own experience, I was also unaware that I could request a room change or classroom change. 
        </p>
        <p>Ultimately, it seems as though the burden to get around campus, and obtain classroom and housing accommodations falls on the students themselves. 
        </p>
        <p>Zullo wrote “We rely on students to communicate their needs.  It is a student’s responsibility to request services and provide the necessary documentation to establish that they have a significant impairment that requires a reasonable accommodation to ensure equal access.”
        </p>
        <p>Due to staffing shortages, AccessLU is sometimes unable to run on the weekends. This has led David to “hesitate” to go to some events. 
        </p>
        <p>According to Sharon, the university has “provided Lyft codes on the weekends to AccessLU passengers so that they can get around campus.”
        </p>
        <p>At the end of the day, both Mika and David agree that the most reliable form of transportation is themselves. 
        </p>
        <p>“I have scars on my arm from crutching,” said Mika.
