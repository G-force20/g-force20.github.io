        <p>Once you can get to the wheelchair accessible entrance to Wilbur, it is super easy to get to the elevator and navigate the building. However, it is extremely difficult to simply get to the door. From E Packer Ave, the street that Wilbur is located on, there is no access to the building without steps. In fact, you can’t even get from this street to the back of the building where the accessible entrances are located. Instead, a person must drive through the Chandler Ullmann Driveway. From there, they must go all the way up to the ramp path (there is a closer one but it has been blocked off by two yellow poles, placed right in the middle of the sidewalk) and then go in a big circle down the narrow twisty path just to get to the “accessible” entrance.

        <p>Gabe and I were interested in how one would get from the Center for Innovation and Learning Technology (CITL) located in the basement of FML to the upper floors. It appeared to us at first investigation that there was not an elevator to the CITL. However, we found that a person in a wheelchair would need to enter the door to the CITL, go down a wheelchair lift to access the CITL. From there, the person would need to go into the atrium at the base of the stairs and enter an unmarked door full of offices. On Gabe and I’s way, a custodial worker had to direct us to the hidden elevator. This elevator can take you to floors 1-6 of FML. To get to the 7th floor, you would have to switch elevators. Although this was not the least accessible building on campus, we believe Lehigh could do a much better job at marking directions to elevators.

        <h3>Christmas Saucon</h3>
        <img src="pictures/xmasaucon.jpg" class="case-pic" alt="A photo of Christmas-Saucon">
        <p>Lehigh University recently moved several student oriented services including The Pride Center, The Center for Gender Equity, and the Multicenter, Study abroad, OMA, and The Source into Christmas Saucon. This building is inaccessible for anything except the first floor. According to Dean Zullo, Disability Support Services and the staff of the moved offices voiced concerns about the relocation of those offices to Christmas Saucon. 
        </p>
        <p>Zullo points to several projects the University is constructing to deal with the inaccessibility of this building including creating an accessible lounge/meeting space in XS 130 on the ground floor of Christmas-Saucon. The Christmas Saucon Annex XS 14A is also an accessible room that can be reserved by request. Zullo wrote: “Each of these spaces can be used by students and other campus community members who may be unable to reach the upper floors of the building.” Zullo also noted that there is an accessible restroom on the first floor of Christmas-Saucon. 
        </p>
        <p>Zullo also said that individual offices encourage students to reach out if they have accessibility concerns.

        <h3>Freshman Dorms</h3>
        <img src="pictures/dravo.jpg" class="case-pic" alt="A photo of the Dravo Freshmen dorm">
        <p>Not a single freshman dorm at Lehigh has an elevator. On top of that, almost none of the freshman dorms are wheelchair accessible. Despite signage outside of Dravo, Richards, and Drinker with wheelchair symbols, it is impossible to enter any of them without going up stairs.
        </p>
        <p>The only handicap accessible freshman dorms are Stevens Hall, which is part of Lower Cents, M&M, and Tayor. For M&M and Taylor, there is a single handicap entrance located at the back of the building. Students in wheelchairs can’t even enter their dorm building from the front. For each of these three buildings, since there are no elevators, the only accessible floor is the one with the entrance. Additionally, for people living in Stevens Hall, the laundry room for the entire Lower Cents complex is located in Williams Hall, which is inaccessible. 
        </p>
        <p>Gabe and I believe the inability to get around to various dorms, not just getting to your own bed, would have a serious impact on making friends as a freshman. The freshman dorm common areas and rooms are a space where freshmen get to know each other, share struggles, and learn how to navigate a difficult and new college environment together. For us, it was a vital part of our experience as college students and how we became friends! The fact that so many freshman dorms and common spaces are inaccessible would undoubtedly impact social life on campus.

        <h3>Drown Hall</h3>
        <img src="pictures/drown.jpg" class="case-pic" alt="A photo of Drown Hall">
        <p>Drown Hall, the English Building, is completely inaccessible and is a building with many classes held throughout the day. This building also holds the Math and Writing Center, an important resource for students at Lehigh. Dean Zullo from the Office of Disability Support Services responded that students may request to have their appointments in another location, or on zoom. She also stressed that students with accessibility needs can request to have their classes moved from Drown to other locations.
