        <h1>Students with State-Issued Disability Placards:</h1>
        <p>If you have a State-Issued Disability Placard, you do not need to contact Disability Support Services. Instead, simply call (610)758-7275 or email inpark@lehigh.edu to apply for a permit. You do not need to fill out any forms through Disability Support Services. 
        </p>
        <p>You will need to send a copy of your state issued disability permit, placard, or plate to the Parking office to inpark@lehigh.edu. 
        </p>
        <p>To request AccessLU transportation services, simply call (610)758-4410 to request on-demand service. 
        </p>
        <p>Then, you will need to download and set up the TransLoc application to request rides. 
        </p>
        <h1>Students without State-Issued Disability Placards:</h1>
        <p>If you are suffering from a temporary injury on Lehighâ€™s campus that limits your mobility, you must complete the <a href="https://cm.maxient.com/reportingform.php?LehighUniv&layout_id=124">Request for Parking or Transportation Accommodation form</a>
        </p>
        <p>You will need to provide medical information including a diagnosis, description of limitations, and suggested accommodations. Specific documentation guidelines can be found at the <a href="https://studentaffairs.lehigh.edu/node/1294">Student Affairs website.</a>
        </p>
        <p>Disability Support Services will then review your request, and contact you and parking services when complete. Then parking services will take over and you will be sent instructions on how to enroll in AccessLU.
