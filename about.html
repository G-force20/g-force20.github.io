        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>This accessibility map project was created by Isabel Koval and Gabe Masso, two Lehigh undergraduate students. In their Junior year, Isabel suffered a broken foot and was on crutches for 6 weeks. Gabe helped Isabel get around, get food, and wait for the AccessLU bus. Both students agree that this campus is not accessible. We hope this project will help those with physical disabilities navigate campus, and provide data to push for structural inclusion on campus. </p>
