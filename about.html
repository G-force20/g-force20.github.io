        <p>This accessibility map project was created by Isabel Koval and Gabe Masso, two Lehigh undergraduate students. In their Junior year, Isabel suffered a broken foot and was on crutches for 6 weeks. Gabe helped Isabel get around, get food, and wait for the AccessLU bus. We hope this project will help those with physical disabilities navigate campus, and provide data to push for structural inclusion on campus. 
        </p>
        <p>This data was collected by the two of us by exploring each building on foot and looking for entrances and handicap parking spots. If you find any inconsistencies or incorrect information please contact us at ikk224 and gbm224 so that we can keep our map up to date!
