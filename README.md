Aight shawty here we go again!

This one is great!

To run simply go to g-force20.github.io 

(again, you might have to reload it the first time if the ma doesn't show up)


Currently, there is only one map on the maps page ut it hass the different color pins for different levels of accessibility. All the building pins work and will show their information when clicked. I only have sub pins loaded for Packard and STEPS, when those buildings are clicked, their info pops up AND their pins pop up, when those pins are clicked, the picture is shown. 

If you want to demo the smaller pins ONLY DO IT FOR PACKARD AND STEPS!!


also, there were a few buildings we hit that weren't on the spreadsheet so I put in the names but I didn't do their info.
